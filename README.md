YProtect
========

Python replacement for XProtect.

Intended to be a replacement for XProtect after disabling it per the instructions shared by Greg Neagle [here][disable]

I am planning on setting it up via launchd to run every 24-hours just like XProtect does now.

A pkg will be coming along soon with a preflight script to disable XProtect, install the launchd plist etc. I probably won't get to that until Thursday or Friday.

Please feel free to commit and issue pull requests. I am a Python n√ºb :)
